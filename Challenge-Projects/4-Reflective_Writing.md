## Due December 11

## Description

Answer the following questions below, which are all about connecting the content of this course to your broader education and long-term plans.

There are no right or wrong answers, but focus on interrogating your own experiences and bringing depth to your reflections. You can draw 
on any other experiences or sources that are helpful in answering the questions. Write at least one decent-length paragraph for each question;
your full set of answers will probably be 2-3 pages.

## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of the course. What were your expectations?

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything)
worked well for you during this time?

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? Do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular classes?

7. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have learned about your own learning as a result of being in this class?

## Answers

1. My expectations going into this class was I was going to learn a lot about networks.  I must admit
    at the beginning of the course I had happiness that I was almost finished with school, sadness that
    I was almost finished with school (I really do like Rollins), anxiety that I needed to finish this
    semester (pretty much was told by the VA that I am required to graduate this month), and that is
    not even considering all the extra stuff that has been going on this year.

2. I felt pretty lost during the sprint 3 assignment.  For some reason I could not get the search to 
    work correctly.  I ended up having to lean heavily on my group.   

3. I can't remember which class it was but we discussed something in class that made me start thinking.
    I ended up mentioning it to my step-dad who is a system admin at Lockheed and we had this really long
    conversation about it.

4. Adaptability and don't be afraid to ask someone else for help.  The adaptability part is from me 
    changing to distanced learning and having to figure out the tricks to make webex not drop me 
    repeatedly.  The other part is back to that sprint 3.  I waited to the last minute to ask for help
    from my group when I should have asked much sooner.  In my head I had blown it up to being such a big deal but they just went "sure no problem".  I have a great group.

5. I started as in person but changed due to one of my classes being remote only.  Remote learning is        interesting if done in the right context.  I don't think I could have done another remote learning       class where the teacher just gives some reading and thats it.  The most challenging for me about 
    remote learning was not being able to discuss something in person.  I am sure you have noticed from
    me that I sometimes speak up about something in class.  Being able to sleep an hour later worked well for me during this remote learning.  

6. I really believe that in-person is better.  I feel teachers plan their class differently if there
    are students in front of them vs talking to a screen.  The only positive aspect that I can think of, don't some teachers record their class?  This might be good to do say if someone misses.  But then it
    can be abused, "why go to class I can just watch the recording later?".  So I don't know.  That's above my paygrade.

7. I have learned that I feel that I am getting dumber.  And it is a really good thing that my school
    career is almost finished.  Nah, I'm playing.  I don't think my learning process changed much from
    this class.  I am probably an outlier by the fact of my situation though.  I think once you reach a 
    point in your life, you really don't change much anymore.
